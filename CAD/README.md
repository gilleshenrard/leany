FreeCAD models for **Leany**

## Important note
[Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) is used to avoid having the repository size explode due to FreeCAD files being binary zipped archives.

To retrieve the actual files and open them with FreeCAD, users must open a Git bash and type in the following command before cloning the repo :

- Windows
```
git lfs install
```

- Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
```

If the repository has already been cloned before installing Git LFS, users can run the following command :
```
git lfs pull
```
