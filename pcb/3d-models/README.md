# 3D Models Directory

This directory contains 3D models sourced from [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/library) and the [Wago website](https://www.wago.com/). The models are used to generate a 3D model of the PCB.

They are organized into subdirectories based on their source and authors.

## Directory Structure

- `grabcad/`
    - Contains subdirectories for each author with their respective 3D models.
- `wago/`
    - Contains 3D models sourced from the Wago website.

## GrabCAD Models

The `grabcad/` directory is organized by author. Each subdirectory within `grabcad/` is named after the author and contains the 3D models they have contributed.

Example structure:
```
grabcad/
├── author1/
│   ├── model1.stl
│   ├── model2.stl
│   └── ...
├── author2/
│   ├── model1.stl
│   ├── model2.stl
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Wago Models

The `wago/` directory contains 3D models sourced from the Wago website. These models are not organized by author.

Example structure:
```
wago/
├── model1.stl
├── model2.stl
└── ...
```

## Usage
